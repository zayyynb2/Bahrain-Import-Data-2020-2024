## Recommendations

1- Reduce dependence on specific countries and diversify suppliers to minimize the risk of price increases or supply shortages.



2- Focus on high-weight items and search for low-cost shipping companies for this category to avoid losses during transportation and storage.



3- Import pieces in small quantities to reduce financial risk, or negotiate with other countries that offer lower costs to obtain better deals. 



4- Reduce imports during low seasons and increase imports during periods of high demand.
